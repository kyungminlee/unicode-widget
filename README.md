There are two ways to search for a unicode character:
- Type in the latex command of the character starting with a backslash `\`, such as `\alpha`, `\otimes`, or even subscripts and superscripts `\^2`, `\_x`.
- Type in the name of the character. It is not case sensitive, and it does not have to be exact.

You can click an entry to copy the character to your clipboard.
